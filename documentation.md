## What is NetWars?
NetWars is a game where you play as an old desktop PC that is woken up by Stapely, an sharp and sarcastic program designed to "help", following a malware outbreak that has taken over most of the technology in the office building.

You start out in the basement, and slowly have to climb floors to get to the top, converting infected co-workers back to normal by integrating them into your own network. But in order to do so, you need to upgrade yourself.

The more upgrades you get, however, the greater risk you have of being infected as well...
